👋 Hi, I’m George Konstantinos Dimou but everyone mostly calls me by my last name, Dimou.

I’m currently studying 👨‍🎓 for my Bachelors degree on [Applied Informatics in University of Macedonia](https://www.uom.gr/en/dai). While studying there I found my true love and passion which is Data Science and I plan to follow that dream until the end.

- Data Science Enthusiast 💻
- Inquisitive Math and Statistics student 👩‍🔬
- Adaptable and dedicated team player 🤝
- Creative problem solver
- Next year I am aiming to enroll for a MSc in [Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics again on University of Macedonia](https://www.uom.gr/en/aida) which is notoriously difficult to get accepted let alone graduate 🤔
